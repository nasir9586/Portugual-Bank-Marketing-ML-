# Portugual-Bank-Marketing-ML-

**Project Overview**
This project aims to optimize telemarketing campaigns for term deposit subscriptions at a Portuguese bank. By leveraging a rich dataset of customer demographics, financial details, and campaign interactions, the project applies machine learning algorithms to predict customer responses and enhance marketing efficiency.

**Dataset Description**
The dataset includes 21 attributes, such as customer age, job, marital status, financial information (e.g., loans), and campaign details (e.g., contact type, last contact month, number of interactions). The target variable is 'y', indicating whether the customer subscribed to a term deposit (yes/no).

**Key Algorithms Used**
Logistic Regression – A baseline model for binary classification, providing interpretability.
Random Forest – An ensemble method that reduces overfitting and increases robustness.
Gradient Boosting (XGBoost/LightGBM) – A sequential learning approach offering high accuracy and efficient handling of large datasets.
Support Vector Machine (SVM) – Optimizes classification by finding the best separating hyperplane.
Neural Networks (MLP) – Captures complex non-linear relationships, enhancing prediction accuracy.
Project Highlights

**LightGBM** achieved the highest accuracy of 96.47%, followed by Random Forest and Logistic Regression.
The project emphasizes the importance of predictive modeling for enhancing marketing strategies, optimizing resource allocation, and improving customer targeting.
Practical recommendations include refining customer segmentation and optimizing outreach timing to improve future campaign success.

**Conclusion**
By adopting machine learning techniques, the project successfully demonstrated the power of data-driven decision-making in marketing. These insights can drive future business growth by improving customer acquisition strategies, increasing term deposit subscriptions, and enhancing overall campaign performance.
