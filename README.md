# Portugal Bank Marketing using Data Science & Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project aims to optimize telemarketing campaigns for term deposit subscriptions at a Portuguese bank. By leveraging a rich dataset of customer demographics, financial details, and campaign interactions, the project applies machine learning algorithms to predict customer responses and enhance marketing efficiency.

## Dataset Description
The dataset includes 21 attributes, such as:
- **Customer Demographics:** Age, job, marital status.
- **Financial Information:** Loans, balance.
- **Campaign Details:** Contact type, last contact month, number of interactions.
- **Target Variable:** 'y' (indicating whether the customer subscribed to a term deposit: yes/no).

## Key Algorithms Used
- **Logistic Regression:** Baseline model for binary classification, providing interpretability.
- **Random Forest:** Ensemble method that reduces overfitting and increases robustness.
- **Gradient Boosting (XGBoost/LightGBM):** Sequential learning approach offering high accuracy and efficient handling of large datasets.
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM):** Optimizes classification by finding the best separating hyperplane.
- **Neural Networks (MLP):** Captures complex non-linear relationships, enhancing prediction accuracy.

## Project Highlights
- **LightGBM** achieved the highest accuracy of **96.47%**, followed by Random Forest and Logistic Regression.
- Feature engineering and data preprocessing significantly improved model performance.
- The project emphasizes the importance of predictive modeling for enhancing marketing strategies, optimizing resource allocation, and improving customer targeting.
- Practical recommendations include refining customer segmentation and optimizing outreach timing to improve future campaign success.

## Conclusion
By adopting machine learning techniques, the project successfully demonstrated the power of data-driven decision-making in marketing. These insights can drive future business growth by improving customer acquisition strategies, increasing term deposit subscriptions, and enhancing overall campaign performance.
